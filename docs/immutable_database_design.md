# Immutable Database Design for Governance Records

This document outlines the immutable database design for storing governance decisions and records. The system uses a triple-storage approach for maximum reliability and tamper resistance.

## ImmuDB (Primary Storage)

ImmuDB is used as the primary storage system due to its cryptographically verifiable immutability.

Key features:
- Cryptographic verification of all records
- Tamper-evident logging
- Built-in history and proof mechanisms
- Immutable data structure

Implementation details:
- Each governance decision is stored as a separate record
- Records include cryptographic signatures from YubiKey verification
- Automatic verification of the database state
- Regular snapshots stored in secure backup locations

## Event Store (Secondary Storage)

Event Store provides a complete history of all governance events using an event sourcing pattern.

Key features:
- Append-only event streams
- Complete history of all actions
- Projections for analytical views
- Built-in subscription mechanisms

Implementation details:
- Every governance action is recorded as an event
- Events are stored in categorized streams
- Regular snapshots for performance optimization
- Subscription handlers for notification services

## PostgreSQL (Tertiary Storage)

A traditional relational database provides rapid querying capabilities and a backup mechanism.

Key features:
- Optimized for complex queries
- Familiar SQL interface
- Rich indexing capabilities
- Easy to backup and restore

Implementation details:
- Normalized schema for governance records
- Robust indexing for fast lookup
- Read-only for governance records (can only be written via the verified path)
- Regular backups to secure locations

## Cross-Verification Service

This service ensures consistency across all three storage systems.

Key features:
- Cryptographic verification of records across systems
- Consistency checking and alerts
- Automated reconciliation for minor discrepancies
- Human alert for major inconsistencies

Implementation details:
- Background service running on a defined schedule
- Compares cryptographic hashes across storage systems
- Notifications for detected inconsistencies
- Audit logging of all verification activities

## Security Measures

1. **Physical Security**:
   - ImmuDB running on air-gapped hardware
   - Geographic distribution of storage systems
   - Hardware security modules for cryptographic operations

2. **Access Controls**:
   - Read-only API endpoints for most users
   - Write access restricted to governance system with YubiKey validation
   - Separate authentication for each storage system

3. **Audit Trail**:
   - All access to records is logged
   - Regular audit reports generated and verified
   - Automated alerts for suspicious activity

## Backup and Recovery

1. **Regular Backups**:
   - ImmuDB: Cryptographically verified backups
   - Event Store: Stream snapshots
   - PostgreSQL: Point-in-time recovery dumps

2. **Disaster Recovery**:
   - Documented recovery procedures
   - Regular recovery drills
   - Automated recovery testing

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1** (Immediate):
   - Set up ImmuDB with basic YubiKey verification
   - Implement core governance record API

2. **Phase 2** (Within 2 weeks):
   - Add Event Store integration
   - Implement cross-verification between ImmuDB and Event Store

3. **Phase 3** (Within 1 month):
   - Add PostgreSQL tertiary storage
   - Complete triple verification system
   - Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerts
