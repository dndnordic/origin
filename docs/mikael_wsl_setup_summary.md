# Mikael WSL GPU Setup - Summary of Work

## Overview

We've successfully set up Mikael's Windows machine with WSL and GPU access for the Origin system, allowing the system to leverage Mikael's NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 GPU for LLM inference operations.

## Setup Components

1. **GitHub Runner Setup**:
   - Created and configured a self-hosted GitHub runner on Mikael's Windows machine
   - Added custom labels: `self-hosted`, `Windows`, `WSL`, `GPU`
   - Verified runner connectivity and functionality

2. **WSL GPU Environment**:
   - Confirmed NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 GPU is accessible from WSL with `nvidia-smi`
   - Created modular GitHub workflows to set up the environment step by step:
     - Basic WSL environment test
     - PyTorch with CUDA support setup
     - WSL connector service setup
   - Successfully executed all workflows on Mikael's machine

3. **Connector Service Implementation**:
   - Created a socket-based connector service in Python that:
     - Runs in Mikael's WSL environment
     - Provides GPU information and capabilities over the network
     - Supports multi-threaded connections for concurrent requests
   - Tested the connector service functionality

4. **Kubernetes Integration**:
   - Created Kubernetes manifests for:
     - Deployment of the LLM connector service
     - Service for network access
     - ConfigMap for configuration
   - Developed a deployment script for easy setup
   - Added documentation and troubleshooting guidance

## Documentation Created

1. **Setup Instructions**: Comprehensive documentation in `docs/mikael_wsl_gpu_setup.md`
2. **Deployment Script**: Created `scripts/deploy-mikael-connector.sh`
3. **Kubernetes README**: Updated with GPU connector information
4. **Workflow Files**: Created modular workflow files for easy maintenance

## Testing

1. **WSL Environment**: Verified WSL access with `uname -a` and `whoami`
2. **GPU Access**: Confirmed GPU availability with `nvidia-smi`
3. **PyTorch/CUDA**: Verified PyTorch can access the GPU
4. **Connector Service**: Successfully tested the connector service

## Next Steps

1. **Full System Integration**: Configure the Origin system to use the GPU connector for LLM inference
2. **Model Loading**: Set up and test loading LLM models like Llama 3
3. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring and logging for the GPU connector
4. **Auto-Start Service**: Configure the WSL connector to start automatically
5. **Backup Strategy**: Set up regular backups of the WSL environment

## Conclusion

The setup provides a cost-effective way for the Origin system to perform LLM operations using Mikael's powerful GPU, without requiring expensive cloud GPU resources. This approach bridges the gap between cloud and on-premise resources, offering a hybrid solution for the system's AI capabilities.
